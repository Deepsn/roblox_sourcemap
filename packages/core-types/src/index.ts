 * wherever a branded string is required. Similarly, `Brand`s with different names are not type
 * compatible with each other.
 *
 * This is useful in practice in several ways.
 * 1. `Brand`s can be used to enforce/track data which has been validated or satisfies some other
 *    invariant.
 * 2. `Brand`s can be used to declare more descriptive types and prevent accidental argument swaps.
 *    E.g., `Brand<string, "UserId">` is not type compatible with `Brand<string, "PlaceId">`.
 *
 * Use the {@link brand} function to "create" a branded value.

 * @example
 * ```
 * type MyObject = {
 *   fieldA: string
 * };
 *
 * const myObject: MyObject = { fieldA: "test" };
 * const userInput: string = "fieldA";

 * // This causes a TypeScript error:

 * const value = recordGet(myObject, userInput);
